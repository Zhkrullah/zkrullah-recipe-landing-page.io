                    <li> <span>Beat the eggs: </span>In a bowl, beat the 
                        eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are 
                        well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or
                         milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
                         <li> <span>Heat the pan:</span>
                            Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat
                             and add butter or oil.</li>
                             <li><span>Cook the omelette:</span> Once
                                the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the
                                 eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly 
                                 coat the surface.</li>

                                    When the eggs begin to set at the edges but
                                     are still slightly runny in the middle, 
                                     sprinkle your chosen fillings over one 
                                     half of the omelette.</li>
                                     <li><span>Fold and serve:</span> As
                                        the omelette continues to cook, carefully
                                         lift one edge and fold it over the fillings.
                                          Let it cook for another minute, then slide
